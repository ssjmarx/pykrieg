A Game of War 

Designed by Guy Debord 


1. Overview 

A Game of War is a strategy game for two players (North and South) simulating military conflict. Unlike Chess, the focus is not just on capturing pieces, but on maintaining a Lines of Communication (LOC) network. 

The Objective: Destroy the enemy by achieving one of the victory conditions (listed in Section 8). 


2. The Battlefield 

The game is played on a grid of 500 squares (20 x 25). The board is divided into North and South territories. Each territory contains: 

     1 Mountain Range: 9 squares of impassable terrain.
     1 Mountain Pass: Allows travel through mountains.
     2 Arsenals: The immobile power sources for your communications.
     3 Fortresses: Defensive structures.
     

Terrain Rules: 

     Mountains: Impassable. They block movement, attacks, and Lines of Communication.
     Mountain Passes: Traversable. They do not block Lines of Communication. They provide a +2 Defense bonus to the occupyinng unit.
     Fortresses: Traversable. They do not block Lines of Communication. They are neutral (any unit can occupy them). They provide a +4 Defense bonus to the occupying unit. Fortresses cannot be destroyed.
          Terrain bonuses apply only when the unit occupying the terrain is the target of the attack. If a unit on a Fortress or Pass is supporting the defense of another unit, it uses its base Defense stat and does not apply the terrain bonus.
     

3. Lines of Communication (The Network) 

This is the game's most critical mechanic. Your units rely on a "network" to function. 

     The Source: Your two Arsenals radiate Lines of Communication vertically, horizontally, and diagonally (45º).
     Relays: You have mobile Relay units that can reflect/extend these lines.
     Staying Online: A unit is considered "Online" if it is in direct connection with an Arsenal or is adjacent to a friendly unit that is Online.
     Going Offline: If a unit is not connected, it goes "Offline."
         Offline Units: Cannot move, cannot attack, and cannot defend themselves (they have 0 defense).
         Exception: An offline unit still receives defensive support from adjacent friendly units.
         Relays: Unlike other units, Relays are always treated as Online, and can always move.  However, they can only bring other units online if they are connected to the communication network.
         OPTIONAL RULE: In the rare case that a line of communication activates a combat unit, and that combat unit is adjacent to a relay which is NOT in the LOC, pykrieg rules that the relay is activated by the adjacency LOC rule, and therefore propogates its own lines of communication.  However, in the original rules by Debord it is unclear if this is the case, so this special case can be toggled off by the user.
      
Blocking the Network:
Lines of Communication are blocked by Mountains and Enemy Units. 

     Note: Lines are not blocked by Mountain Passes.
     

4. Units & Stats 

Each player starts with the same force. All stats are listed as Attack / Defense / Movement / Range. 

Headquarters 

     Arsenal: Immobile. No Defense. Radiates communication.
         Special Rule: An enemy destroys your Arsenal simply by moving onto it (if empty). This counts as the attack for that turn.
        
    Communication Units 

     Relay: Atk 0 / Def 1 / Move 1 / Range 0.
     Swift Relay: Atk 0 / Def 1 / Move 2 / Range 0.
     
Combat Units 

     Infantry (x9): Atk 4 / Def 6 / Move 1 / Range 2.
         Sturdy and reliable.
         
     Cavalry (x4): Atk 4 / Def 5 / Move 2 / Range 2.
         Fast. Special Ability: Charge.
         
     Cannon (x1): Atk 5 / Def 8 / Move 1 / Range 3.
         Slow but long-ranged and hard to kill.
         
     Swift Cannon (x1): Atk 5 / Def 8 / Move 2 / Range 3.
         A faster version of the Cannon.
         
     
5. Setup 

    Each player places their units freely within their own territory. 
    Opponent set-ups are hidden until the game begins. 
    Roll a die to determine who moves first. 


6. Turn Sequence 

A turn consists of two phases: Movement and Combat. 

A. Movement Phase 

     The player may move up to 5 units per turn.
     You may move fewer than 5.
     A unit cannot move more than once per turn.
     Mounted Units (Cavalry, Swift Cannon, Swift Relay): If they move out of their lines of communication, they stop on the first square they enter in which they go offline.     


B. Combat Phase 

     The player may perform 1 Attack per turn.
     Attacking is optional.
     You may attack any enemy unit within range.
     Line of Sight: Attacks and defensive support can pass through friendly units, but are blocked by enemy units.
     
How Attack & Defense Work:
Combat is calculated by comparing power numbers along straight lines (vertical, horizontal, or diagonal). 

    Calculate Attack Power: Sum the Attack stats of all your units in a direct line with the target enemy unit. 
    Calculate Defense Power: Sum the Defense stats of all enemy units in a direct line supporting the target. 
    Compare the Totals:
         Offense ≤ Defense: The attack fails. The unit is secure.
         Offense = Defense + 1: Forced Retreat. The defender must move that unit at the start of their next turn. If there is no valid square to retreat to, the unit is captured (destroyed).
         Offense ≥ Defense + 2: Capture. The defending unit is destroyed immediately.
          
Cavalry Charge: 

     If a Cavalry unit is adjacent to the target, its Attack power increases from 4 to 7.
     Up to four Cavalry in a line can stack this bonus, raising the total attack up to 28.
     

7. Special Rules & Restrictions 

     Occupation: Only one unit may occupy a square at a time (Arsenals, Fortresses, and Passes included).
     Cavalry Restrictions:
         Cavalry cannot charge if the target is in a Fortress or Mountain Pass.
         Cavalry cannot charge if they are currently inside a Fortress.
         Cavalry can charge if they are inside a Mountain Pass.
         A charge line cannot pass through a Cavalry unit occupying a Fortress (as that unit cannot charge), effectively breaking the formation. A charge line may pass through a Cavalry unit occupying a Mountain Pass.
         
     
8. Summary of Victory 

To win the game, you must completely destroy the enemy's capacity to fight. You win instantly if you accomplish one of the following: 

    Total Annihilation: You destroy the last of your opponent's units. 
    Network Collapse: None of your opponent's units are online, or you destroy both of their arsenals.
    Surrender: Your opponent declares you the victor.
