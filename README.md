A Pythonic wargame engine for Guy Debord's *Le Jeu de la Guerre* (A Game of War).

## About

Pykrieg is a Python library that implements the complex rules of Guy Debord's strategic tabletop game, providing a clean, extensible API for developers to build custom interfaces, AI opponents, and analysis tools. The project is inspired by the successful **python-chess** library and follows similar design principles.

## Features

- **Complete Game Engine**: Full implementation of Debord's strategic game rules
- **Clean API**: Intuitive Pythonic interface modeled after python-chess
- **Extensible Design**: Easy to create custom variants, unit types, and victory conditions
- **Format Support**: Game record and position formats for saving/sharing games
- **Console Interface**: Interactive terminal-based gameplay (v0.1.5)
- **Well-Tested**: Comprehensive test suite with 89%+ code coverage

## Installation

```bash
pip install pykrieg
```

For console interface with mouse support:

```bash
pip install pykrieg[console]
```

## Quick Start

### Console Interface (Casual Players)

Launch the interactive console game:

```bash
python -m pykrieg.console
```

Play using simple commands:
- `move 5,10 6,10` - Move a unit
- `attack 5,12` - Attack a target
- `pass` - Skip attack phase
- `end` - End turn
- `help` - Show all commands

### Python API (Developers)

```python
from pykrieg import Board

# Create a board
board = Board()

# Add units
board.create_and_place_unit(5, 10, 'INFANTRY', 'NORTH')

# Move a unit
board.make_turn_move(5, 10, 6, 10)

# Attack
board.switch_to_battle_phase()
result = board.make_turn_attack(1, 12)

# End turn
board.end_turn()
```
