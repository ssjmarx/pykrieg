"""Combat system for Pykrieg.

This module implements vector-based combat calculation for all unit types.
Combat is calculated by comparing power numbers along straight lines
(horizontal, vertical, diagonal).

Combat resolution:
- Attack ≤ Defense: FAIL (nothing happens)
- Attack = Defense + 1: RETREAT (defender must move next turn)
- Attack ≥ Defense + 2: CAPTURE (defender destroyed)

Scope for 0.1.3:
- Vector-based line detection (8 directions)
- Attack power calculation with cavalry charge bonus
- Defense power calculation
- Capture/retreat resolution logic
- Terrain-independent (terrain modifiers added in 0.2.1)
- Range-independent (range validation added in 0.2.0)
- Lines of communication not considered (added in 0.2.0)
